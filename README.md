# Team LogicLegends Proxmed Hackathon Hypodense Segmentation AI Project.


## Team Members
- Vishal Lazrus
- Ritesh Kumar Singh

## Project Overview
The objective of this hackathon challenge is to develop a robust and efficient algorithm or AI model capable of accurately segmenting the hypodense region from Brain Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) images. The primary goal is to automate and streamline the identification of early ischemic changes in acute stroke patients.

## Project Structure
The project data has been organized in the following format:

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. Extracted zip data and converted it into the specified structure.
2. Preprocessed data to dimensions (128, 128, 128).
3. Performed additional data preprocessing.

## Data Visualization Steps
1. Conducted 2D visualization with different axes.
2. Combined image and label for visualizing hypodense regions.
3. Utilized 3D visualization techniques and HTML5 video visualization.

## Models Implemented
1. **3D U-Net Model (CNN)**
   - Developed a convolutional neural network model for 3D data.
   - Training, testing, and evaluation were carried out.

2. **V-Net CNN Model for 3D Data**
   - Implemented an alternative CNN model for 3D data.
   - Conducted training, testing, and evaluation.

## Additional Steps
- Explored different visualization techniques for better understanding.
- Used Kaggle to host and share data: [Kaggle Data Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishallazrus/filtaer-data)
